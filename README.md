Book a workout room every morning at 8 am if the date is selected on the React app

This application is a MERN stack application that on the front end it is a calendar that the user can select certain dates for the Puppeteer application to run on Node js.
Puppeteer is a npm package that allows you to make headerless requests. This is a personal project to help a friend's grandparents with an automating booking system.
